# Draw on my phone Game Rules

## Overview
Draw on my phone is a hilarious party game that combines drawing and guessing. Players alternate between drawing pictures and guessing what those pictures represent, creating chains of interpretations that often end up hilariously different from where they started.

**Important**: Physical pass-the-phone gameplay where each player joins the game room and has a phone and rotates their phone around the table simultaneously.

## What You Need
- **3-8 players** (best with 4-6)
- **One phone per player**
- **Stable internet connection** for all devices

## Game Flow

### 1. Setup Phase
**Host Configuration**:
- Person that creates the game room is the host
- Set timer duration (default: 60 seconds per turn)
- Set's when to start the game (after all players have joined the room)
- Countdown timer for starting each round

**All Players**:
- Scan the QR code with your phone to join the game room
- Wait for everyone to join the game room
- Once everyone has joined, the host can start the game

### 2. Word Selection Phase
- Each player is shown **5 random words/phrases**
- Select **1 word** to start your chain
- All players select simultaneously

### 3. Gameplay Phase

The game works differently based on the number of players to ensure it always ends on a guess:

#### With ODD Number of Players (3, 5, 7, etc.)

**You select a word but DO NOT draw it yourself**

1. **Select your word** (shown 5 options, pick 1)
2. You are instructed by the app to **pass your phone** to the next player immediately
3. **Receive someone else's phone** with their word
4. **Alternate between drawing and guessing** for each round
5. **Game ends** when the chain completes (always ends on a guess)
6. **Return phones** to original owners for reveal

**Example with 5 players**:
```
Player A's phone journey:
- Round 0: Player A picks "Firefighter" → PASS
- Round 1: Player B draws "Firefighter" → PASS
- Round 2: Player C guesses "Person with hose" → PASS
- Round 3: Player D draws the guess → PASS
- Round 4: Player E guesses "Watering flowers" → GAME ENDS
- Return phone to Player A (who now sees the chain)
```

#### With EVEN Number of Players (4, 6, 8, etc.)

**You select a word AND draw it yourself**

1. **Select your word** (shown 5 options, pick 1)
2. You are instructed by the app to **draw your word** on your phone
3. **Pass your phone** to the next player
4. **Receive someone else's phone** with their drawing
5. **Alternate between drawing and guessing** for each round
6. **Game ends** when the chain completes (always ends on a guess)
7. **Return phones** to original owners for reveal

**Example with 4 players**:
```
Player A's phone journey:
- Round 0: Player A picks "Firefighter" and draws it → PASS
- Round 1: Player B guesses "Person with hose" → PASS
- Round 2: Player C draws the guess → PASS
- Round 3: Player D guesses "Watering flowers" → GAME ENDS
- Return phone to Player A (who now sees the chain)
```

### 4. Reveal Phase
- Each player receives their original phone back
- See the complete chain: Original word → Drawings → Guesses → Final guess
- Pass phones around to explore other players' chains
- Vote on favorite chains (funniest, most accurate, best art, etc.)

## Detailed Rules

### Drawing Rules
- **Use provided tools**: Pen, eraser, color picker
- **No words, letters, or numbers** in your drawings
- **No symbols** that are essentially letters (☮, ♻️, etc.)
- **No talking** about what you're drawing while timer is active
- **Timer enforced**: Submit before time runs out or drawing auto-submits

### Guessing Rules
- **Write a word or short phrase** (1-3 words recommended)
- **Only see the previous drawing** - You cannot see earlier steps
- **Timer enforced**: Submit before time runs out or guess auto-submits

### Passing Rules
- **Pass in the same direction** throughout the game (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
- **Everyone passes simultaneously** when:
  - Timer ends
- **Physical handoff**: Actually give the phone to the next player
- **You cannot peek**: You can only see the previous drawing or guess, the rest of the chain is hidden from you.

### Timer Rules
- Same time limit for all drawing AND guessing rounds
- Host sets timer before game starts (default: 60 seconds)
- If time runs out:
  - Drawings: Auto-submitted as-is (even if incomplete)
  - Guesses: Auto-submitted as-is (even if incomplete)

## Scoring (Optional)

While Draw on my phone is primarily a party game about fun and laughter, you can optionally vote on:

- **Best Artist**: Best drawings across all chains
- **Funniest Player**: Most hilarious player in the game
- **Most Accurate Guesser**: Most accurate guesser in the game

## Tips for Great Gameplay

**For Drawing**:
- Keep it simple - stick figures work great!
- Use the whole canvas
- Add context clues (background, multiple elements)
- Don't overthink it

**For Guessing**:
- Write your first instinct
- Be specific enough to be drawable
- Keep it short (2-3 words ideal)
- Think like an artist - what would YOU draw for this?

**For Fun**:
- Don't take it too seriously
- Embrace the chaos when chains go off-track
- The funnier the final results, the better!
- React and discuss during reveal phase

## Example Complete Chain

### Starting Word: "Walking the dog"

```
Round 1: Player B draws a stick figure with a leash and small dog
Round 2: Player C guesses "Taking pet outside"
Round 3: Player D draws person opening door with cat
Round 4: Player E guesses "Letting cat out"
Round 5: Player A (if 5 players) draws cat exiting through door

REVEAL:
Original: "Walking the dog"
Final Guess: "Letting cat out"

The dog became a cat! 🤣
```

## Troubleshooting

**Phone not receiving updates?**
- Check internet connection
- Refresh the app
- Rejoin the session

**Timer too short/long?**
- Host can adjust before next game
- 60 seconds is usually perfect
- Shorter (30-45s) for fast chaos
- Longer (90s) for detailed art

**Player dropped out?**
- Game may need to restart
- Ensure all players maintain connection
- Consider having backup device ready

**Remember**: The goal is to have fun and laugh at the creative interpretations. The best chains are the ones that go hilariously wrong!
